Question 4: Calculate the RSI Error for the dataset where error is expressed as the difference between the 
Force Plate RSI measurement and the Accelerometer RSI measurement. Fit this error distribution to a normal curve and 
plot a histogram of the data on the same plot showing the fitted normal curve. Include appropriate labels, titles, and
